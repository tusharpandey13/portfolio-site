//         Above, the stars were unwinking, also constant. Suns and worlds by the
//         million. Dizzying constellations, cold fire in every hue. As he watched,
//         the sky washed from violet to ebony. A meteor etched a brief,
//         spectacular arc below Old Mother and winked out. The fire threw strange
//         shadows as the devil-grass burned its slow way down into new patterns -
//         not ideograms but a straightforward crisscross vaguely frightening in
//         its own no-nonsense surety. He had laid his fuel in a pattern that was
//         not artful but only workable. It spoke of blacks and whites. It spoke of
//         a man who might straighten bad pictures in strange hotel rooms. The fire
//         burned its steady, slow flame, and phantoms danced in its incandescent
//         core. The gunslinger did not see. He slept. The two patterns, art and
//         craft, were welded together. The wind moaned. Every now and then a
//         perverse downdraft would make the smoke whirl and eddy toward him, and
//         sporadic whiffs of the smoke touched him. They built dreams in the same
//         way that a small irritant may build a pearl in an oyster. Occasionally
//         the gunslinger moaned with the wind. The stars were as indifferent to
//         this as they were to wars, crucifixions, resurrections. This also would
//         have pleased him.
